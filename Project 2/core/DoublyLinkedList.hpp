// ICS 46 Spring 2020
// Project #2: Time Waits for No One
//
// DoublyLinkedList<ValueType> is a class template that implements a
// doubly-linked list with head and tail pointers, including two kinds
// of iterators: One of them allows viewing and modifying the list's
// contents, while the other allows only viewing them.
//
// Your goal is to implement the entire public interface *exactly* as
// specified below.  Do not modify the signatures of any of the public
// member functions (including the public member functions of the various
// iterator classes) in any way.  We will be running extensive unit
// tests against your implementation, which will not compile unless
// things remain completely unchanged.  As we did in Project #0, we've
// provided you a basic set of unit tests that briefly demonstrate how
// each of the member functions is required to behave; you'll find
// those in the "gtest" directory.
//
// All of the public member functions listed with "noexcept" in their
// signature must be implemented in a way that they never throw exceptions.
// All of the others are expected to make the "strong" exception guarantee,
// which means two things: (1) no memory has leaked, and (2) the contents
// of the list/iterator will not have visibly changed in the event that
// an exception has been thrown.
//
// The entire C++ Standard Library is off-limits in your implementation
// of this class.  DO NOT submit a version of this file (or any file
// that it includes) that includes any C++ Standard Library headers.
// (This includes things like adding a print() member function that
// requires <iostream>.)
//
// As is good custom in class templates, keep the interface separate
// from the implementation.  This means the bodies of member functions
// should not be written in the class declaration, but should appear
// below it.  I've placed "dummy" implementations of every public
// member function, though, of course, most of them don't do the
// right thing; but they will save you some typing and demonstrate
// the structure of what you should be writing.
